        `All the water contained in a wine comes from the grape. It doesn't matter if it's white, red, pink. 
        Even if it is sparkling, it cannot added to the wine by any method.
        In fact, almost all the components of the wine come from the grape, or are the product of some components of the same.`,
    
        `Grapes quality is significatly impacted by the origin of the irrigation water, wich has disolved several coumpounds and, althought seems to be insignificant, they have a relevant participation in the pH of the grape, and that impacts on wine. 
        The acidity concentration is the key for wine aging, aromas complexity, and wine mouthfiling.`,
        
        `However, water isn't the only way for oenologists to manage the grape acidity. For that goal they can work whit diferents techniques, and the most relevants are:`,
        
        `Harvest in order to regular the solar exposition.
        It is because of the sun energy that vines, by a photosintetic proces, converts the organic acids in sugars that will be fermented by yeast.
        So that, a high sun exposure will bring grapes with high sugar degrees, but whit flat acidity. Those aren't the kind of grapes that a wine-maker wants for a long term wine`,
        
        `Althought grape varietal its been told to be the most significant factor for wine acidity, they have more like a second participation on it.
        Remaining leaders in terms like region adaptation, aromas development, and polifenolic charge`,
        
        `Finally, Wine makers can regulate acidity levels in bodegue and we will discouse that in other molecules.`,

        `As we see, the water represents more than 80% in wine volume, so it will have a very significant role in all the wine experience`
