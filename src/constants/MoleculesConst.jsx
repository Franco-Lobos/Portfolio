        `There are 5 main molecules, be sure to click on each molecule to fully enjoy the experience.`,
        `The forms and angles of each bond are meant to be proportional, but for display reasons, I have used different scales in larger molecules. Since it is a 2D representation, double bonds have not been drawn yet, but I am planning to include them in the next version.`,

    water:{
        description:[
        `All the water contained in a wine comes from the grape. It doesn't matter if it's white, red, pink. 
        Even if it is sparkling, it cannot added to the wine by any method.
        In fact, almost all the components of the wine come from the grape, or are the product of some components of the same.`,
    
        `Grapes quality is significatly impacted by the origin of the irrigation water, wich has disolved several coumpounds and, althought seems to be insignificant, they have a relevant participation in the pH of the grape, and that impacts on wine. 
        The acidity concentration is the key for wine aging, aromas complexity, and wine mouthfiling.`,
        
        `However, water isn't the only way for oenologists to manage the grape acidity. For that goal they can work whit diferents techniques, and the most relevants are:`,
        
        `Harvest in order to regular the solar exposition.
        It is because of the sun energy that vines, by a photosintetic proces, converts the organic acids in sugars that will be fermented by yeast.
        So that, a high sun exposure will bring grapes with high sugar degrees, but whit flat acidity. Those aren't the kind of grapes that a wine-maker wants for a long term wine`,
        
        `Althought grape varietal its been told to be the most significant factor for wine acidity, they have more like a second participation on it.
        Remaining leaders in terms like region adaptation, aromas development, and polifenolic charge`,
        
        `Finally, Wine makers can regulate acidity levels in bodegue and we will discouse that in other molecules.`,

        `As we see, the water represents more than 80% in wine volume, so it will have a very significant role in all the wine experience`

    ethanol:{
        description:[
            `Ethanol is a simple alcohol responsible for ethanol intoxication (it gets people drunk). Contrary to their "neighbors"  alcohols ingestion, (Methanol and Propanol ), humans' evolution provide us with an ethanol tolerance which allowed our ancestors to eat fruits even when they were "rotten.`,
        
            `Ethanol appears in these fruits through the fermentation of the natural sugars contained in them, which get metabolized by yeast. Yeast is a fungus that has a presence in almost every natural environment and gets attached to the grape by the same structure that grape peels cells provide.`,
            
            `When the grapes are squished, the sugar contained in their juice turns available for the yeast to metabolize it. This microbiological process is denominated in "alcoholic fermentation", and it produces, among others:  Ethanol, Carbon dioxide, Glicerol, aromatic molecules (secondary aromas in wine), and methanol in minimum concentration.`,
            
            `So, the most relevant fermentation products are:`,
            
            `Ethanol: all the ethanol managed in wine comes from yeast fermentation, which is why the ethanol concentration in wine will get limited by the sugar contained in the grape. In addition, factors such as temperature ( directly proportional to ethanol production.) or pH during this fermentation will affect yeast performance and, in consequence, the ethanol concentration.`,
            
            `Carbon dioxide: it will be conservated only in sparklings. Otherwise, we are talking about still wine, which elaborating process should liberate Carbon dioxide from the wine.`,
            `We will discuss Glicerol in its respective molecule.`,
            `As a resume, yeast metabolism has a tremendous influence on the winemaking process, so Oenologists manage the regulating factors that regulate yeast performance. Such as temperature and pH, among others, to make the projected wine.

    glycerol:{
        description:[
        `Glycerol is a Diol formed as a byproduct  during the fermentation process when yeast consumes the grape sugar and converts it into alcohol.`,
        
        `It characterize for beeing responsible for the viscous or "oily" texture that is often associated with certain wines, particularly those that are high in alcohol content.`,
        
        `We can affirm that Glycerol is an important component of wine because it contributes to the wine's mouthfeel and can enhance its perceived sweetness. Wines that have a higher concentration of glycerol tend to have a smoother, richer texture and can be more full-bodied. In addition, it can help to balance out the acidity and tannins in wine, making it more harmonious and enjoyable to drink.`,
        
        `Overall, glycerol is an important and beneficial component of wine, and its presence can have a significant impact on the wine's flavor, texture, and overall quality.`

    organicAcids:{
        description:{
            tartaricAcid:[
                `Tartaric acid is a naturally occurring organic acid found in grapes, and it is a key component in the process of winemaking. When grapes are crushed, tartaric acid is released from the skins and pulp of the grapes and into the juice. As the juice ferments and turns into wine, tartaric acid plays an important role in the flavor and stability of the wine.`,

                `Tartaric acid helps to balance the sweetness of the wine by providing a sharp, acidic taste. It also helps to preserve the wine by inhibiting the growth of harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Additionally, tartaric acid can contribute to the texture and mouthfeel of the wine.`,
                
                `After fermentation, tartaric acid can sometimes crystallize and form deposits, known as wine diamonds or tartrates, which can be removed through a process called cold stabilization. This process involves lowering the temperature of the wine to encourage the tartaric acid to crystallize and settle at the bottom of the container.`,
                
                `Overall, tartaric acid is an important component in the grapes and winemaking process, and it plays a crucial role in the flavor, stability, and quality of wine.`

            malicAcid: [
                `Malic acid is another organic acid found in grapes and is also present in many wines. Malic acid gives wines a tart, green apple-like flavor, and it is an important factor in the overall acidity and taste balance of the wine.`,

                `During winemaking, malic acid can undergo a secondary fermentation process called malolactic fermentation (MLF), also known as lactic fermentation. This process involves the conversion of malic acid into lactic acid and carbon dioxide by lactic acid bacteria, such as Oenococcus oeni`,

                `The primary purpose of malolactic fermentation is to reduce the acidity of the wine by converting the harsher-tasting malic acid into the smoother-tasting lactic acid. This can improve the mouthfeel and texture of the wine and enhance its flavor complexity. The process of MLF can also reduce the risk of spoilage and improve the stability of the wine.`,

                `Malolactic fermentation can occur naturally, but it is often induced by winemakers through the addition of specific strains of lactic acid bacteria. The timing and control of the MLF process are critical, as it can have a significant impact on the final character and quality of the wine.This process can take several weeks to complete.`,

                `In summary, malic acid is an important organic acid found in grapes and wines, and it can undergo malolactic fermentation to convert it to lactic acid and improve the overall taste and stability of the wine.`
            ],

            lacticAcid: [`
            Lactic acid is not usually found in significant amounts in wine, except as a result of malolactic fermentation (MLF),it is often desired in red wines, some white wines, and some sparkling wines to achieve a smoother, more rounded taste and reduce acidity.`,

            `The presence of lactic acid in wine is generally desirable and can contribute to the wine's overall complexity and balance. However, if MLF occurs spontaneously or in an uncontrolled manner, it can result in off-flavors and aromas, such as buttery or cheesy notes, which may not be desirable in certain styles of wine.

            Winemakers can control the MLF process by using specific strains of lactic acid bacteria and monitoring the wine's pH and temperature to ensure that the conversion of malic acid to lactic acid occurs smoothly and does not result in any off-flavors or spoilage.

    polyphenols:{
        description:{
            anthocyanins:[`Anthocyanins are natural pigments found in the skins of red and purple grapes, and they are responsible for giving red wines their color. During the winemaking process, the juice from the grapes is left in contact with the skins to extract the anthocyanins, as well as other compounds, such as tannins and flavors, from the skins.`,

            `Anthocyanins belong to a group of compounds known as flavonoids, which are antioxidants that are also found in many fruits and vegetables. In addition to providing color to red wines, anthocyanins can also contribute to the wine's aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel.`,
            
            `The amount and composition of anthocyanins in wine can vary depending on several factors, such as grape variety, climate, and winemaking techniques. For example, cooler climate regions tend to produce wines with higher anthocyanin content, while warmer climates may result in wines with lower anthocyanin levels and a lighter color.`,
            
            `Anthocyanins are sensitive to changes in pH, temperature, and light exposure, and they can degrade over time, resulting in changes to the wine's color and taste. To prevent this, winemakers may use techniques such as aging the wine in oak barrels or using additives like sulfur dioxide to protect the wine's color and stability.`,
            
            `In summary, anthocyanins are important pigments found in the skins of red and purple grapes, and they play a key role in the color, aroma, flavor, and stability of red wines.`],
            
            resveratrol:[`
            Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grape skins, seeds, and stems, and it is known for its antioxidant properties. Resveratrol has gained attention in recent years due to its potential health benefits, such as reducing the risk of heart disease, improving insulin sensitivity, and reducing inflammation.`,

            `Resveratrol is found in high concentrations in red wines, especially those made from grape varieties like Pinot Noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. The concentration of resveratrol in wine can vary depending on several factors, including grape variety, winemaking techniques, and wine storage conditions.`,

            `The health benefits of resveratrol have been the subject of many studies, but the amount of resveratrol in a glass of wine is relatively small compared to the amounts used in research studies. Nonetheless, moderate consumption of red wine has been associated with health benefits, and some researchers believe that resveratrol may play a role in these benefits.`,

            `It's worth noting that while resveratrol is a potential health-promoting compound found in wine, excessive consumption of alcohol can have negative health effects, and any potential health benefits of resveratrol should be balanced against the risks associated with drinking too much alcohol.`,

            `In summary, resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in grape skins and is present in red wines in varying concentrations. While it has potential health benefits, the amount of resveratrol in a glass of wine is relatively small, and the risks associated with alcohol consumption should also be considered.`],

            tannins:[`
            Tannins are a group of polyphenolic compounds found in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes, as well as in oak barrels used for aging wine. Tannins contribute to the structure and mouthfeel of wine, providing a sensation of astringency or bitterness, and they also play a role in the wine's color stability and aging potential.`,

            `Tannins are more commonly found in red wines than in white wines, as red wines are fermented with the grape skins, where the tannins are located. White wines are usually fermented without the skins, resulting in lower tannin levels.`,

            `Tannin levels can vary depending on grape variety, climate, and winemaking techniques. For example, grapes grown in cooler climates tend to have higher tannin levels, and extended maceration and aging in oak barrels can increase tannin levels in wine.`,

            `The presence of tannins in wine can affect its flavor and aroma. Tannins can contribute to the wine's overall complexity, adding flavors of leather, tobacco, or cedar, and they can also help balance the wine's sweetness or acidity. However, excessive tannins can make a wine taste harsh or astringent, and they can overwhelm the other flavors in the wine.`,

            `Tannins also play a role in a wine's aging potential. Over time, tannins can polymerize (with anthocyanins giving them more stability) and become less astringent, resulting in a smoother, more balanced wine. However, if a wine has too little tannin, it may not age well and may lose its structure and complexity over time.`,

            `In summary, tannins are a group of polyphenolic compounds found in the skins, seeds, and stems of grapes and oak barrels. They contribute to the structure and mouthfeel of wine, affect its flavor and aroma, and play a role in its aging potential.`
